Problem Statement : 
There is a call center in which there is a hierarchy of employees who can attend the call. Freshers should attend the call first, followed by leads and finally the manager. If the fresher wants to escalate the call he/she can escalate it to the leads. Also, a lead can escalate the call to the manager. We can suppose that there are many freshers, many leads, and only one manager. If at any point in time no employees are free to attend the call, the caller should wait in the queue. Once an employee is free he/she can take the call.
